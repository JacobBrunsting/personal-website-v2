<p class="description">
    I am a second year student at the University of Waterloo, in the
    Computer Science Co-op program. I enjoy learning more about software 
    development, both in my classes, and through personal projects and work experience.
    I am especially interested in continuing to gain experience in back end development.

<h3 class="expand-on-scroll">Communication Skills</h3>
<p class="description">
    At my first co-op position, I worked on an Android app with a variety of
    developers of varying skill levels, requiring me to clearly explain what
    I was going to be working on, and how it would impact them.
</p>
<p class="description">
    At my second co-op position, I spent 4 months pairing with experienced
    software developers, requiring me to be in constant communication with
    them and clearly and quickly explain my ideas, and how I was planning on
    approaching problems.

<p class="description">
    I have taken several courses on data structures and software development,
    introducing me to important design patterns and common algorithms, and 
    teaching me proper programming practices.

<h2 id="workExperience" data-nav-title="Work Experience" class="expand-on-scroll in-nav">Work Experience</h2>
<h3 class="expand-on-scroll">TribalScale <span class="heading_date">(January - April 2017)</span></h3>
<p class="description">
    At TribalScale I had the opportunity to pair with senior software
    developers through their use of the XP design methodology. I worked with
    various developers on several projects, including an Android app, and a 
    website (written in Javascript using React and Redux)
</p> 
<p class="description">
    Pairing with other developers
    improved my communication skills, and also allowed me to learn how they 
    write code, and have my coding technique improved by their critiques as
    I am writting.
</p>
<h3 class="expand-on-scroll">WeMesh <span class="heading_date">(May - August 2016)</span></h3>
<p class="description">
    At WeMesh, I worked on developing their Android app that allows you to
    watch videos while chatting with your friends over text and Voip. At
    WeMesh I had significant independence, and was able to influence the 
    direction of the app, working with the company founders to 
    determine what new features to implement, and proposing large structural
    changes and refactors to the code base, which I independently carried out.
</p>
<p class="description">
    My employers at WeMesh gave me a rating of 'Outstanding' (the highest 
    possible rating in the University of Waterloo co-op system) after my 
    co-op term, and said that I was a 'great team member' with 'great
    communication skills.'
